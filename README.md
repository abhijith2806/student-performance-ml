Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning
## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on academic and behavioral factors using Machine Learning classification algorithms.

##  Dataset Features
- Study Hours per Week
- Attendance Rate
- Previous Grades
- Participation in Extracurricular Activities
- Parent Education Level

##  Target Variable
- Passed (Yes / No)

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
 
##  Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

##  Results
